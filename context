CYBER SECURITY 
MAJOR ROJECT 

UNDER ESTEEMED GUIDENESS OF Ms. YANDAMURI UMADEVI 

ABSTRACT :
 
This project explores the use of port enumeration as a security testing technique, with the goal of gaining access to a Metaploitable operating system. Metaploitable is a vulnerable virtual machine that is designed for use in security training and testing. It is a Linux-based operating system that contains a variety of vulnerable software and services, including web servers, databases, and network services. 
 
To gain access to the Metaploitable operating system, we used port enumeration to identify the open ports and services on the system. This information was used to plan and execute further security testing and attacks, in order to gain access to the system. 
 
Overall, the project was successful in demonstrating the value and effectiveness of port enumeration as a security testing technique, and provided valuable insights into the vulnerabilities and security risks of the Metaploitable operating system. There are many further developments and areas of exploration that can be pursued in this area, and this project provides a valuable starting point for further work in this field.

INTRODUCTION :
 
•	Metaploitable is a vulnerable virtual machine that is designed for use in security training and testing. It is a Linux-based operating system that contains a variety of vulnerable software and services, including web servers, databases, and network services. 
 
•	One way to gain access to a Metaploitable operating system is through port enumeration, which is the process of identifying the network services and ports that are open and available on a computer or network. This information can be useful for security testing, as it can help identify potential vulnerabilities and security risks that can be exploited to gain access to the system. 
 
•	To perform port enumeration on a Metaploitable operating system, users can use a variety of tools and techniques, including network scanners, port scanners, and other specialized tools. These tools can be used to identify the open ports and services on the system, and can also provide additional information such as the version of the service and the software that is running on it. 
 
•	Once the open ports and services have been identified, users can then use this information to plan and execute further security testing and attacks, in order to gain access to the Metaploitable operating system. This can include techniques such as scanning for known vulnerabilities, testing for weak or default passwords, and exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain access to the system. 
 
•	Overall, port enumeration is a valuable tool for security testing and can be used to gain access to a Metaploitable operating system. By identifying the open ports and services on the system, users can better understand its vulnerabilities and security risks, and can use this information to plan and execute more effective security testing and attacks.

PROJECT METHODOLOGIES  :
 
There are a few key steps to gaining access to an operating system (OS) using port enumeration: 
 
1.	Identify the target OS 
2.	Enumerate open ports and services 
3.	Search for vulnerabilities 
4.	Exploit vulnerabilities 
5.	Maintain access 
 
1. Identify the target OS: In order to gain access to a specific OS, you must first determine which OS is running on the target system. This can be done using various tools and techniques, such as examining the banners or headers of network services, running OS fingerprinting tools, or using network scanning tools to identify open ports and services. 
 
2	Enumerate open ports and services: Once you have identified the target OS, the next step is to enumerate the open ports and services on the system. This can be done using a port scanner tool, which sends a series of probes to the target system and identifies which ports are open and which services are running on those ports. 
 
3	Search for vulnerabilities: Once you have identified the open ports and services on the target system, the next step is to search for known vulnerabilities that affect those services. This can be done by examining security advisories, checking online databases of vulnerabilities, or using vulnerability scanning tools to automatically search for known vulnerabilities. 
 
4	Exploit vulnerabilities: If you have identified a vulnerability that affects one of the services running on the target system, the next step is to exploit that vulnerability to gain access to the system. This can be done using a variety of tools and techniques, such as running a exploit code or using a pre-built exploit tool. 
 
5	Maintain access: Once you have gained access to the system, the final step is to maintain that access and ensure that you can continue to access the system in the future. This can be done by installing a persistent backdoor on the system, or by establishing a secure connection (such as a VPN or SSH tunnel) that you can use to access the system in the future. 
 
Overall, gaining access to an OS using port enumeration involves identifying the target OS, enumerating open ports and services, searching for vulnerabilities, exploiting those vulnerabilities, and maintaining access to the system. These steps require a combination of technical knowledge and tools, and may involve some trial and error in order to successfully gain access to the system.

CONCLUSION  :
 
•	In conclusion, the goal of this project was to gain access to a Metaploitable operating system using port enumeration. This is a
